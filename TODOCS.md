TODO LIST Client Side
=========

UI is 100% JS/Jquery, no library hacks allowed. 

I'm thinking in using these:

- Jquery Datatables 
- Jeditable
- Jvalidate ?
- jQuery Visualize

Please sugest other.


1. Change all jquery to newest version

2. Restore originial files jquery.datatables, jeditables, validate, (I think they were a bit hacked)

3. Test all the functions, modify.
