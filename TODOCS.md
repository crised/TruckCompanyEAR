TODO LIST Client Side
=========

UI is 100% JS/Jquery, HTML5, no library hacks allowed. 

We can focus on Chrome & tell our customers to use Chrome as I understand that it's more complicated to develop in IE.

Still for 'first time impression' it would be nice if it can be shown correctly on IE.

Jquery Mandatory:

  Jquery UI
  
  Theme Roller
  
  Datatables.net
  

Please sugest other if needed.


1. Change all jquery to newest version

2. Restore originial files jquery.datatables, jeditables, validate, (I think they were a bit hacked)

3. Test all the functions, modify.

Possible issues: 

1. Browser tab change

Nice example of AJAX/Flot: (Ajax call, then picks a link in JSON format)
